# Adobe MCP Project Status

*Last Updated: 2025-01-05*

## üö® Major Update: Monorepo Migration Complete

The project has been successfully migrated to a **pnpm monorepo structure** with separate packages for shared code, InDesign server, and Illustrator server. This provides better code organization, maintainability, and deployment flexibility.

## üéØ Current Implementation

### InDesign MCP - Production Ready ‚úÖ
- **52+ tools** across 10 categories
- **Status**: Fully operational with evolutionary testing
- **Challenge**: Optimizing LLM tool selection decisions

### Illustrator MCP - Implementation Complete üîß
- **44 tools** across 9 categories  
- **14 test workflows** with mock testing
- **Status**: Awaiting real-world testing with Adobe Illustrator

## üìã Development Roadmap

### Immediate (This Week)
- [ ] Test all 44 Illustrator tools with actual Adobe Illustrator
- [ ] Fix any ExtendScript runtime errors
- [ ] Validate workflow execution end-to-end
- [ ] Document API quirks and workarounds

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)
- [ ] Configure Peekaboo visual testing on macOS
- [ ] Set up Claude Desktop dual-mode (InDesign/Illustrator)
- [ ] Profile and optimize ExtendScript performance
- [ ] Run evolutionary testing on Illustrator tools

### Medium-term (Month 2)
- [ ] Cross-application workflows (asset sync)
- [ ] Creative Cloud Libraries integration
- [ ] Batch processing optimization
- [ ] Enhanced error recovery mechanisms

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (requires pnpm)
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install

# Build all packages
pnpm run build

# Run InDesign server
pnpm --filter indesign-server start

# Run Illustrator server
pnpm --filter illustrator-server start

# HTTP mode with app switching
cd packages/shared
MCP_APP_MODE=indesign tsx src/http-server.ts
MCP_APP_MODE=illustrator tsx src/http-server.ts

# Run tests
pnpm test
```

## üìä Technical Metrics

| Component | InDesign | Illustrator |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Tools | 52+ | 44 |
| Test Coverage | 85% | 0% (pending) |
| Workflows | Production | 14 test scenarios |
| Performance | ~1-3s/operation | TBD |
| LLM Accuracy | 60-70% | TBD |

## üêõ Known Issues

### Critical
- Position filter schema fixed (tuple ‚Üí object)
- Illustrator tools untested with real application

### Non-Critical  
- LLM tool selection suboptimal
- Performance degrades with large documents
- Some complex layouts fail accuracy tests
